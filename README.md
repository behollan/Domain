# Domain

Domain is the backbone for a home automation suite focused on seamless integration with every day life. Most home automation devices require rather consistent monitoring and though they are "smart" they still require occasional input from the user. Domain aims to use RFID technology to detect the users location in their home and provide them with automatic evironmental adjustments based on pre-defined preferences. When the user changes locations in their home, their new environment is automatically prepared for them.
